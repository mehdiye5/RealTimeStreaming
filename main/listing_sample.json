    "description": "Under construction - estimated completion in August 2019.  The Pioneer features an expansive open floorplan, 3 spacious bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, and a stunning kitchen. Upon entering the Pioneer, you will pass through the impressive entry way. Keep walking, and you will pass the two private secondary bedrooms which both have large walk-in closets. The entryway leads you into the huge open family room and kitchen area with a huge island with granite counters.  Next to the kitchen is the dining room, conveniently separated from the main living area of the family room.  A large covered patio greets you as you walk out the back door into the backyard.  A private and spacious master suite is the cherry on top of this home and will provide a quiet place for you to relax after a long day.  This home is very close to the fantastic amenity center.  All of this in just 1472 sqft is a deal that you will find very hard to beat!",
